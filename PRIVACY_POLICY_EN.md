## BeatCalc Privacy Policy

**Effective date**: 2026-02-04  
**Scope**: This Privacy Policy applies to BeatCalc (the “App”) and explains how information is handled when you use the App on your device.

This App follows Google Play guidance related to privacy and deceptive behavior (see: [Privacy, Deception and Device Abuse](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/topic/9877467)).

### 1. Information We Collect

The App does **not** require you to create an account and does **not** actively collect or upload personally identifiable information.

To provide the **calculation history** feature, the App stores the following information **locally on your device**:

- **Calculation content**: the expression you enter (expression) and the calculated result (result)
- **Date information**: a date value used to group and display history items (date)

This information is stored only within the App’s private local storage (app sandbox) using a local database.

### 2. How We Use Information

Local calculation history is used only to:

- **Display history in the App** (so you can review and reuse past calculations)
- **Support clearing history** (only when you choose to do so)

### 3. Sharing of Information

**We do not share your data with third parties.**  
The App does not include third-party SDKs for advertising, analytics, or crash reporting that collect your data, and we do not sell, rent, or otherwise disclose your calculation history or other data to third parties.

### 4. Permissions and Device Access

In the current version, the App does **not** request sensitive permissions such as network access (for example, `INTERNET`) and does not need access to contacts, location, camera, microphone, SMS, or other sensitive information to provide core functionality.

### 5. Data Storage, Retention, and Deletion

- **Storage location**: local storage (inside the App sandbox)
- **Retention**: kept until you clear history in the App or uninstall the App
- **Deletion**: you can delete stored history using the “Clear history” option in the App

#### Android System Backups (May Occur)

The App enables Android backup-related configuration (for example, `allowBackup`). Depending on your device and system settings, **your App data (including calculation history) may be included in system backups or device-to-device transfers**. This behavior is controlled by the Android system and your device configuration, and is not initiated by the App itself.

### 6. Security

We take reasonable measures to keep data limited to local storage. However, no software can guarantee absolute security. If your device is compromised (for example, rooted/jailbroken, infected by malware, or accessed by an unauthorized person), your local data may be at risk.

### 7. Children’s Privacy

The App is not primarily directed to children and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

### 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy when App functionality or data handling changes. We will update the effective date above when changes are made.

### 9. Contact Us
